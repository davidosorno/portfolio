        I have always been passionate about coding and technology and became a proactive software developer, proficient in multiple programming languages. I love coding and creating new solutions from scratch or refactoring someone else's code. <br>
        I have been focused on Android development since 2013 with Java, then in 2018 I started learning Kotlin to improve my skills and got my Android Associate Certification in Kotlin by Google Developers in March 2020.
        I also went to Coding Dojo to learn more about web development and I got Black Belt for each stack I worked on.<br><br>
        I really love pets, especially dogs, and I enjoy taking them on hikes whenever I can.<br>
        Lastly, my other passion are bikes, nothing like listening to a super sports bike when it is going to shift up.
